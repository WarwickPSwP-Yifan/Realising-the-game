# Realising-the-game

This code is for realizing the '0_determinant game' by python, it will provide help on finding the final strategy to any n.

Although the program of 'Bot' is based on the property of random, it does not follow the logic of 'aiming to win the game'. In other word, for example in a 3*3 matrix, an a row with 3 entries, 2 of them is filled by 0, the randomness may make the 'Bot' place its '1' on the other grids instead of preventing the formation of my 0-row. Randomness can use a easy way to simulate the game but it may hand over the victory. Further rule-making to the 'Bot' is necessary.
